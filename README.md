# PyBer_Analysis
  ### Overview of the Analysis
    The purpose of this analysis is to represent how different the price of Pyber fares are based on the city they opperate in. 
    This will help determine which cities may need to make adjustment in their prices to produce more output or to get more clients to use thier ride services.
  ### Results
    We notice that the more dense the city is, the more riders and drivers there are that use and drive for Pyber. Rurual areas do not show too much attention to the need to such service while the Urban areas show a lot more activity. 
    It is more convenient for someone to pay for a ride to get somewhere than dealing with driving their own vehicle in traffic and finding and paying for parking.
    We also can notice that the more drivers there are, the more rides will be available to accomodate the demand of service. 
    The average fare per driver and ride are smaller in Urban areas as well because the rides tend to be shorter distances causing the fare cost average to be less. 
    In Rural areas, the distance between A and B tend to be a large drive distance which result in a large fare cost for rider.

  ### Summary
    There is a consistant trend for each city as the months go by so busy isn't dropping or climbing dramatically at any given point. 
    What we need to focus on is driver count and cost. Rural cities are the lowest of the three cities. My first suggestion is adding more drivers in the Rural cities first to see if usage rises. 
    Drivers are taking more time per client as ride times last longer, not allowing them to be available for other needed clients. 
    Adding more drivers will help avoid any missed client opportunity. My second suggestion would reduce the cost of ride in Rural areas. 
    Clients are already having to pay more out of pocket due to the distance driven so lowering the cost my incourage the clients to either do it more often or invite new clients the opportunity for service. 
    My third suggestion would be focused on Urban cities and that is slightly increasing the fare cost for rides but not too much to push clients away.
    Urban citizens have a higher need and desire for the service to begin with so increasing the cost by a slight bit wont push them away as they need the service regardless, and at the same time increase more revenue to afford more drivers in the Rural areas where product wont be as high but still would want to service client needs there too.
